## Project Abstract

**NextGenLegal** is an innovative legal services platform designed to make legal access simple, affordable, and scalable across India.

Initially launched as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore in Q2 2025, the platform targets reaching over 50,000 users in the first year, expanding later into Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.

NextGenLegal focuses on three major service areas:

- **Legal Consultation** – Smart matching of users with attorneys based on specialization and language preference.
- **Document Automation** – Easy generation of NDAs, rental agreements, partnership deeds, and other legal documents.
- **Compliance Monitoring** – Personalized alerts for GST filings, contract renewals, and more.

The platform integrates with Indian APIs like UPI, DigiLocker, and Aadhaar to provide seamless and localized user experiences. With multiple revenue models, including subscriptions, pay-per-use, and commission structures, NextGenLegal ensures financial viability while remaining accessible.

The long-term goal is to build a **pan-India legal ecosystem** grounded in **trust, transparency, and technology**.

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
